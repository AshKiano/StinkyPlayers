## What is StinkyPlayers?
StinkyPlayers is a unique Minecraft plugin that introduces an element of hygiene into the gameplay.

## How does it work?
Players must periodically immerse themselves in water, or they will start to "stink" - a condition that is visually indicated by particles surrounding the player. This element of realism provides a fun new challenge to players and can lead to interesting gameplay scenarios, especially in multiplayer environments.

When a player begins to stink, nearby players are affected by the 'nausea' effect, introducing a tactical element to the game. Players might need to strategize to avoid stinky companions or plan their moves accordingly to avoid getting hit with the nausea effect. It's a lighthearted yet engaging feature that adds an unexpected twist to the typical Minecraft experience.
